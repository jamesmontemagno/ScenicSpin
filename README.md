# ScenicSpin

> One source. Two scenic worlds. Pedal a mountain pass or walk a coastal boardwalk — all from your living room.

**ScenicSpin** is a monorepo that builds two sister Progressive Web Apps from a single shared codebase. Each site turns curated, full‑screen scenic YouTube routes into a calm, distraction‑free way to move indoors — no account, no backend, no tracking.

## 🌐 The Sister Sites

ScenicSpin ships as two independent, white‑labeled sites built from the same templates. They share everything except brand identity, accent color, activity vocabulary, and route catalog.

| | 🚴 **PedalScape** | 🚶 **BeltScape** |
|---|---|---|
| **Live site** | [pedalscape.com](https://pedalscape.com) | [beltscape.com](https://beltscape.com) |
| **Activity** | Indoor cycling | Treadmill walking |
| **Device** | Any bike + screen | Any treadmill + screen |
| **Accent color** | `#38e8a4` 🟢 | `#4d9de0` 🔵 |
| **Tagline** | *Any bike. Any screen. Beautiful rides from home.* | *Any treadmill. Any screen. Beautiful walks from home.* |
| **Routes** | ~40 curated rides | ~24 curated walks |
| **Config** | [`sites/pedalscape.config.json`](sites/pedalscape.config.json) | [`sites/beltscape.config.json`](sites/beltscape.config.json) |
| **Catalog** | [`routes/catalog.json`](routes/catalog.json) | [`routes/beltscape-catalog.json`](routes/beltscape-catalog.json) |

## ✨ Features

- **Curated scenic routes** — Hand‑picked, embeddable YouTube videos of bike rides, city walks, and nature trails, tagged with location, terrain, difficulty, duration, scenery, and camera style.
- **Full‑screen player** — Pick a route and launch it full‑screen on a laptop, tablet, or TV. No distractions, no chrome.
- **Local‑first, serverless** — No accounts, no database, no API. Everything runs in the browser.
- **Favorites & history** — Star routes and resume recent activity. Stored in `localStorage` on your device only.
- **Installable PWA** — Add to your home screen; the app shell works offline thanks to a service worker.
- **Privacy‑friendly embeds** — Videos use `youtube-nocookie.com` and link/embed official public streams only (never downloaded or rehosted).
- **5 languages** — English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Turkish, with runtime `{{token}}` substitution.
- **Filter & search** — Browse routes by scenery, terrain, difficulty, and duration.

## 🧠 How It Works

ScenicSpin is a **template + token** system. The repo root holds shared source templates with `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders. A small Node.js build script reads a per‑site config, substitutes the tokens, injects localized vocabulary, copies the right catalog and icons, and emits a fully static site into `dist/<site>/`.

```
                 sites/pedalscape.config.json ─┐
                 sites/beltscape.config.json  ─┤
                                               ▼
  index.html ─┐                       ┌──────────────────┐         dist/pedalscape/  ──▶ pedalscape.com
  src/app.js  ├─ {{TOKENS}} ─────────▶│  scripts/build.js │──────▶
  styles.css  │                       │  (token inject +  │         dist/beltscape/   ──▶ beltscape.com
  service-    │                       │   locale merge +  │
   worker.js  │                       │   asset copy)     │
  manifest    ┘                       └──────────────────┘
  locales/*.json
  routes/*catalog.json
  icons/<site>/
```

Because there is no runtime backend, the build's only job is to produce static files. GitHub Actions then pushes each `dist/<site>/` into its own deploy repo, which serves via GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Local Development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (build script uses only built‑ins — no `node_modules` required to build)
- **Python 3** (for the static preview server) *or* any static file server
- **npm** (only needed to install Playwright for tests)

### Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/shanselman/ScenicSpin.git
cd ScenicSpin

# 2. Build a site into dist/<site>/
node scripts/build.js pedalscape      # or: npm run build:pedalscape
node scripts/build.js beltscape       # or: npm run build:beltscape
npm run build:all                     # both at once

# 3. Preview the built site
npm run preview:pedalscape            # serves dist/pedalscape at http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run preview:beltscape             # serves dist/beltscape at http://127.0.0.1:5174
```

> ⚠️ **Always preview the built `dist/` output, not the repo root.** The root files contain raw `{{TOKENS}}` and won't render correctly until the build substitutes them.

### Handy scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build:pedalscape` | Build PedalScape into `dist/pedalscape/` |
| `npm run build:beltscape` | Build BeltScape into `dist/beltscape/` |
| `npm run build:all` | Build both sites |
| `npm run preview:pedalscape` | Static‑serve PedalScape on port `5173` |
| `npm run preview:beltscape` | Static‑serve BeltScape on port `5174` |
| `npm run check` | `node --check` syntax‑validate `src/app.js` |
| `npm run test:pedalscape` | Build + run Playwright tests for PedalScape |
| `npm run test:beltscape` | Build + run Playwright tests for BeltScape |
| `npm run test:all` | Test both sites |

## 🎬 Adding a Route

Routes live in each site's catalog: `routes/catalog.json` (PedalScape) or `routes/beltscape-catalog.json` (BeltScape). Add an entry to the `routes` array:

```json
{
  "id": "isar-river-bavaria-autumn-4k",
  "title": "Bavaria in Full Autumn Glory along the Isar River",
  "sourceUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbfR4p_-tGE",
  "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbfR4p_-tGE",
  "sourcePlatform": "youtube",
  "creator": "Virtual Cycling Workouts",
  "location": "Isar River, Bavaria, Germany",
  "durationMinutes": 109,
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "terrain": "paved cycle path, river valley",
  "sceneryTags": ["river", "autumn", "countryside", "bavaria"],
  "videoQuality": "4K",
  "audio": "natural sounds, no music",
  "cameraStyle": "handlebar-mounted first-person POV",
  "embeddingAllowed": true,
  "license": "Platform-hosted public stream; reuse governed by YouTube terms.",
  "curationNotes": "Official public video; oEmbed resolved. Do not download or rehost."
}
```

**Curation rules (please honor these):**

- ✅ Link/embed **official public streams only**. Use the `youtube-nocookie.com/embed/<id>` form for `embedUrl`.
- ✅ Confirm the video allows embedding (`embeddingAllowed: true`) and re‑check before launch — platform settings change.
- ❌ Never download, proxy, mirror, or rehost a creator's video files.
- Give each route a unique, descriptive kebab‑case `id`.
- Not ready yet? Park candidates in [`routes/candidate-backlog.json`](routes/candidate-backlog.json).

After editing, rebuild and the new route appears in the catalog automatically (`build.js` copies the site's catalog to `dist/<site>/routes/catalog.json`).

---

## 🌍 Internationalization

Each locale file in [`locales/`](locales/) holds ~164 keys. `en.json` is the **source of truth**. Strings support runtime `{{token}}` substitution so the same phrase reads correctly per site:

```json
"hero_copy": "Jump into curated scenic {{activity_verb}} routes, then launch a fullscreen {{activity_noun_singular}} on your laptop, tablet, or TV."
```

### How the build localizes per site

`build.js` post‑processes every locale on its way into `dist/`:

1. **Always‑overwrite keys** — brand/URL keys (`site_name`, `sister_site_name`, `sister_site_url`, …) are forced from the site config so they're never accidentally translated.
2. **Fallback activity keys** — `activity_noun_singular`, `activity_verb`, `activity_device`, etc. are injected **only as fallbacks**. A translator‑provided value always wins; English stubs get replaced with the site's word (e.g. `ride` → `walk`).
3. **Per‑language overrides** — `beltscape.config.json` carries a `localeOverrides` block with proper walking vocabulary for each language (Spanish *caminata*, French *marche*, Italian *passeggiata*, Turkish *yürüyüş*…), applied last.

This is why one set of locale files produces both "ride / cycling / bike" and "walk / walking / treadmill" copy across five languages.

### Adding a new language

1. Copy `locales/en.json` to `locales/<lang>.json` (e.g. `de.json`).
2. Translate every value. Leave `{{tokens}}` intact — they're substituted at runtime.
3. Leave brand keys (`site_name`, `sister_site_*`) as‑is; the build overwrites them.
4. For BeltScape, add a matching block to `localeOverrides.<lang>` in `sites/beltscape.config.json` with the walking vocabulary for that language.
5. Register the language wherever the locale list is wired in `src/app.js` (the language picker).
6. Rebuild and verify: `npm run build:all`, then preview and switch languages.

## 🛠 Build System

`scripts/build.js` is a single, dependency‑free Node script. Run it with a site slug:

```bash
node scripts/build.js <pedalscape|beltscape>
```

What it does, in order:

1. **Loads** `sites/<slug>.config.json`.
2. **Cleans** `dist/<slug>/`.
3. **Token‑substitutes** the template files — `index.html`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `service-worker.js`, `src/styles.css`, `src/app.js` — replacing placeholders like `{{SITE_NAME}}`, `{{ACCENT_COLOR}}`, `{{SHELL_VERSION}}`, `{{CACHE_NAME}}`, `{{ACTIVITY_NOUN}}`, and more.
4. **Copies** the site's icon set (`icons/<slug>/` → `dist/<slug>/icons/`) and shared `assets/`.
5. **Localizes** every file in `locales/` (brand overwrite + activity fallbacks + per‑language overrides).
6. **Copies the catalog** — the site's catalog is always emitted as `routes/catalog.json` so `app.js` is site‑agnostic — plus `candidate-backlog.json`.
7. **Writes** a `CNAME` (the site domain) and a merged `manifest.webmanifest` (with site categories).

### Cache busting

The service worker cache is named by `cacheName` (e.g. `pedalscape-shell-v7`), derived from `shellVersion`. **Bump `shellVersion` in the site config whenever you ship shell changes** — it changes the cache name, so returning visitors fetch the fresh shell instead of a stale cached one.

### A few key tokens

| Token | Source field | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{{SITE_NAME}}` | `siteName` | `PedalScape` |
| `{{ACCENT_COLOR}}` | `accentColor` | `#38e8a4` |
| `{{SHELL_VERSION}}` | `shellVersion` | `7` |
| `{{CACHE_NAME}}` | `cacheName` | `pedalscape-shell-v7` |
| `{{CATALOG_FILE}}` | `catalogFile` | `catalog.json` |
| `{{ACTIVITY_NOUN}}` | `activityNoun` | `rides` / `walks` |
| `{{ACTIVITY_DEVICE}}` | `activityDevice` | `bike` / `treadmill` |
| `{{SISTER_SITE_URL}}` | `sisterSiteUrl` | `https://beltscape.com` |

---

## 🧪 Testing

End‑to‑end tests run in **Playwright** (Chromium). The runner reads the `SITE` env var to pick the right config and serves the built `dist/<site>/`.

```bash
npm run test:pedalscape     # build + test PedalScape
npm run test:beltscape      # build + test BeltScape
npm run test:all            # both

# Or directly against an already-built site:
SITE=beltscape npx playwright test
```

Coverage includes catalog loading and result counts, the full‑screen player, favorites, and the offline service‑worker shell.

## 📦 Deployment

Deployment is automated by [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) on every push to `main`:

```
push to main
   │
   ├─ test  (matrix: pedalscape, beltscape)
   │     build each site → run Playwright tests
   │
   └─ deploy  (needs: test)  (matrix: pedalscape, beltscape)
         build dist/<site>/  →  force-push to shanselman/<site>  →  GitHub Pages
```

- Each site is **built and tested independently** in a matrix job; a failing site blocks its own deploy.
- The built `dist/<site>/` is force‑pushed to a **separate deploy repo** (`shanselman/pedalscape`, `shanselman/beltscape`) using a `DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret.
- Each deploy repo serves via **GitHub Pages**, with the `CNAME` file (written by the build) mapping it to its custom domain.

You can also trigger the workflow manually via **workflow_dispatch**.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome — new routes, translations, fixes, and shell improvements.

- **Add a route** → follow [Adding a Route](#-adding-a-route) and honor the curation rules (official embeds only).
- **Add/fix a translation** → see [Internationalization](#-internationalization). Keep `{{tokens}}` intact.
- **Change the app shell** → edit the templates at the repo root / `src/`, then **bump `shellVersion`** in the affected site config(s) so caches refresh.
- **Before opening a PR** → run `npm run check` and `npm run test:all`, and preview both built sites.

Please keep the projects local‑first and privacy‑friendly: no analytics, no accounts, no rehosted video.
